## React typography system
This is a collection of tools and conventions I've used to create a typography system. It uses styled-components and styled-system to allow you to import typeography styles and override both the styling and markup like so: 

```jsx
<Canon tag="p" color="red">
  Canon
</Canon>
```

I've this approach to re-create GEL, the CSS based typography system by the BBC. 
Examples of this are on CodeSandbox and the full process is documented on Medium.
